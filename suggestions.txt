Me:
- when you don't have skins but you DO have something made from a skin, you
  get an empty inventory screen when applying at a tannery
- Additional profiling improvements
- Pets!
- Debug into set_hostility and figure out why it's not setting for Snakes etc
- More Acey/Sea Captain quests
- Acey quest to steal Ironsword and deliver to Atua-Elar after it's retrieved.
  - Emperor should transfer Ironsword to the armory
  - change the lock
  - Give the key to a special mob
  - Deliver to Atua-Elar
  - Stage 1 of the uprising
- Make taverns more distinctive
- NEED TO DO AN ASSET RELEASE
- Do a couple of quests that require a party
  - Isen Dun (Hrimgar): envoy to Forest of Yew (PoGA)
  - Carcassia (Golgoa): wyrms attacked Stoneheim, wizard killed, tower wants 
    you to deliver his apprentice robes and staff (+ench?) (ench scroll, 
    5x magici shard)
- Test by generating these in Carcassia, Gnordvar
- Long term, give a chance for coastal generators to produce coastline, maybe
  with little islands, etc. Before generating, set booleans for coast in
  the different directions and then pick one. Should be done after the initial
  fill but before adding stuff
- New sector features:
- UndergroundSectorFeature (takes tile type - dungeoncomplex, mine, cavern,
  sewer)
- Settlement names!
- Settlement names on signposts!
- Add signposts to each random village
- Generate tombs with keys outside door/doors locked
- First urchin stone has no message!
- Feature: fence, east_west_fence. Add some fenced areas to set locations.
- Fenced areas (veg gardens?) in villages
- Wyrm level stupid slow?
- Need to get hirelings text-searchable in bestiary
- Creatures try to cast utility spells when they don't make sense (uncursing,
  etc). Should be checks to see if effect makes sense.
- Next release: need to do an asset release
- Sector features for regular settlements
- Things to make villages more interesting:
  - Archery ranges (contests, using ranges should train ranged, etc)
  - Graves
  - Ponds w/ benches
  - Caverns
  - Sewers
  - Mines
  - fenced area with gate: pigs, chickens
  - tavern with low-level adventuring party
- Each version: make sure to update itch.io page for both SotW and the sprite
  pack! OpenGameArt if new sprites.
- Release after this: grond says tanning is complicated & dragon skins aren't
  what they should be.
- Mode screen (F10): Game mode, graphics, palette
- Beer halls in villages
- spell arcana (bind to capitals in spell list)
- Do creatures pause when no threats in FOV? Seems slow.
- google screen clear not working for SDL. reported 2x.
- 2x draw?
- Beastmastery: add mounts
- Grond: attacking turtles causes some kind of ToD crash after teleporting
  and maybe other stuff?
- EACH VERSION: clean up the usage of some shared_ptrs.  These should be
  unique_ptrs, generally, and method calls should use raw pointers or
  const&.
- After locking/unlocking, the next input seems to blank the entire screen.
  (This is an SDL Direct3D rendering issue with dynamically loaded textures
  becoming invalidated.)
- Do additional profiling after shared_ptr cleanup
- Look at race balance: stats, speed, skill points, etc
- Shield punch!
- Fruit trees should generate fruit annually.
- Write script to check for any items without CodexDescriptionSID
- The "descend to" functionality
- Sections of Carcassia should be open to random generation, with some
  parts of each map being set.
- "The Vertical City"
- refactor the huge function in ShadowOfTheWyrmEngine.cpp
- Tidy up scripts/quests into subdirectories, like carcassia, and test.
  Need to remember to update env.lua!
- More guilds/things with memberships
- Improve spellcasting AI so that spells are only considered when adjacent
  if the expected damage is greater than the expected damage of a melee
  attack.
- The guarded, empty areas in Carcassia C2 should lead to some kind of
  dungeon/special area.
- Email Nathan before next release re: Mac build check
- More special terrain rooms, and then slightly increase the probability so
  that dungeons are more interesting.
- Penalties from bloodied, exposed should also scale with level.
- The Ybari/Asturias?
- Negative rings/amulets: ring of poison, spellbound amulet.
- Names should work into combat messages, etc
- Buildings generated in towns should automatically get inhabitants.
- Explore the cities Carcassia is built on top of.
- Wind should have a chance to "carry" flames.
- Revisit smithing.
- Do something with the Order Ex Gladiatores
- Revisit how values are updated after enchantment.
- Unnecessary refresh being called for generator? (refreshing overworld
  when it shouldn't)
- The vaults of the old dwarven-kings
- Allow shopkeepers to be any of the selectable races.
- Towers/tower generators.
- Reuse some of the sector feature generators in dungeons - tomb, etc.
- Descent into the underworld.
- Allow shopkeepers to sell for different prices depending on their
  race, and the buying creature's.
- Wilderness ruins/lairs
- Dungeon vaults
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Craft different launchers/projectiles as skill increases.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- SDL: full screen
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: magical workshop, armory.
- More shops in set locations.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.  Use profiler - check out LOS code,
  pathfinding, etc.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Update MapTester config for generation runs of creatures
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Armour flags
- More guilds
- Food rotting for caught fish, other foods?
- Message when doing checkpoint saves to indicate why the delay happens.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.
- Group like items together (scrolls, etc) even if not exactly the same
- Lit FOV
- Can probably keep most of the SDL_PollEvent calls in the controller.  
  With proper framerate throttling or delays could do more interesting 
  animations, etc.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.

Esran:
- Once monsters are smarter, create spells that allow hitting monsters
  past walls.
- Sewer/dungeons: when random, prompt for "descend to what depth (ft)?

kain:
- Towns not repopping with the same types of creatures as before (e.g.,
  ogres).
- Shops not generating fully stocked.

ssteam
- w->, w-< to autowalk to stairs
- Descend via '>' while in air.
- More secrets!
- Balance artifacts - mostly blades

- more diverse artifact effects (HP/AP regen, stat bonuses, etc)

naughtusername: 
- Skill descriptions on shift+letter or something

Timo:
- Can kill off guards one by one, emperor doesn't care.

Mirza Ghalib:
- Wide displays are causing text in e.g. the Isen Dun Chronicle to
  mess up (see the section about Gnordvar). 88x25

hapro:
- Drop multiple items at once
- Option to "pause" after certain triggers. When paused the game would
  ignore all inputs until space pressed. Example triggers: dropping below
  15% health, taking more than 50% in single attack, beginning to starve,
  etc.
- Separating corpses and food into separate autopickup groups - want to
  auto pickup food, but not corpses
- Auto pickup triggers when leaving a map on a tile you're leaving from.
  e.g. Drop an item on edge of town, leave town, item picked up.

Rob Ayres
- Aging attacks and potions of youth

Troubler: 
- Doors in dungeon occasionally get spawned in a big, long line.

Grond:
- Torment-type spell (1/2 HP)
- you see flickering even in areas where LOS is blocked by a wall
- Switching with townsfolk (in churches?) leads to weird behaviour
- Adjacent creatures attack on load
- Differentiate scribing and wandcraft - why use scribing?
- Scything on ammo?
- could magic skill affect spell duration
- monster as a mount
- "some ivory pieces shimmers in a radiant light"
- fishing from boat, fish vanish

Yan Zhang:
- Dungeon symbol should generate that thing on the last level
- Do something interesting with flowers!
- Climb up Telari: more NPCs

Skjarl:
- SDL resizing

Stof:
- mouse click pathfinding

mission opossumable:
- alternate tiles e.g. different grass tiles
- seconded ^^ (Valduk)

YARD:
- creatures of a certain deity (frostlings and shiver, black servants and
  sceadugenga) shouldn't attack you if you worship that deity
- spell details on shift+letter
- corpse weight
- wilderness, low level creatures, etc

IceBox: 
- can the confirm setting be allowed to change on load?

Paul Blay:
- Allow enchant to hit equipment too

Josh Engdahl
- Rebindable paging keys
- Fleeing behaviour for humanoids
- User macros
- Add info on the weapon synopsis to the manual
- max fire res on fire spirits, etc
- support for "extending" good status effects via drinking multiple potions,
  etc

- when hiding and checking stuff, spirits in walls don't seem to count against
  the checks
- don't step out of shadows if creatures don't have you in LOS
- weird age incrementing issue?
- make undead hostile to e.g. all humanoids
- Cancel prompts should clear text: kick, drop, etc
- nearby guards/priests should get angry when altars are desecrated
- Rocky earth generator 1n Carcassia
- Warping out of levels doesn't put you back at the default entry position
- Freeze not always working when hostile creatures in view or creatures 
  hostile to leader in view?
- waterbreathing flag, similar to incorporeal, flying, etc
- los code: .@..   can't see
            ####s

- can lure ancient monsters into trap room and kill them via an unwillingness
  to move on to trapped tiles.

Phantom:
- escort quest with very fragile NPC
