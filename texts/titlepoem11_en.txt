I saw pale kings and princes too, %b
    Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; %b
They cried - "La Belle Dame sans Merci %b
    Hath thee in thrall!"
%p
I saw their starved lips in the gloam, %b
    With horrid warning gaped wide, %b
And I awoke and found me here, %b
    On the cold hill's side.
